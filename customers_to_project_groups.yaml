# When adding a new group, it must be added to either generic_groups or platform_groups
# It must also be added for each customer to either include_groups or exclude_groups
# Some consistency checks are done by the automated release process :
# - a customer group must belong to either generic_groups or platform_groups
# - a customer group must not be in both include_groups and exclude_groups

# bsp-priv group is a special group, because it is used in combination with
# the <customer>_external annotation that takes several values:
# - "no" means that the project is not released externally
# - "src" means that the source content is released
# - "bin" means that only binaries are released
# This is the reason why bsp-priv is in [include_groups] in below customer definitions
